# Pneumonia Detection Project

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting pneumonia from medical images. Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious lung infection, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can automate the detection process and assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more accurately and efficiently.
